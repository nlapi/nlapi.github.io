                    <h3>Site Contrast:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The site I liked the least was Gigaom</li>
                        <li>They do a good job providing realted news to what their visitors are looking for.</li>
                        <li>Their visitors get most of the information they want, but it takes a long time, thus not reaching the max they could come up with.</li>
                        <li>The website is orginasied well for the most part</li>
                        <li>Mobile users dont have as good experience that desktop users do. Given the fact that most of the online users come from
                            a mobile, the site needs to change to accomodate that. Navigation is a bit harder, especially if you look for something specific.
                            On a deskpot its easier to navigate. </li>
