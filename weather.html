<h2>Purpose Statement</h2>

<p> The goal of this site is to provide accurate weather
searvices that is up to date, and simple to use
for all people.</p>

<h2>Audience</h2>

<p> This weather's site audience will be anyone that would like real-time, and updated weather informoation, from a college student, to someone driving their children to school. The age-range that visit the site would be from 11 to 75. We believ that our users will use their mobiles to access the site
more often than desktop, laptop or any such.TIme of use would be mostly early in the morning
before leaving to go somewhere or late at night, to check the weather for the day to come</p>
